pnpm preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.

## Deploy on CloudFlare Pages

Make sure to create a GitHub OAuth application for your production deployment.

Once you linked your GitHub/GitLab repository, add the following env variable:

```bash
NODE_VERSION=18
NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD=your-secret-password-of-at-least-32-chars
NUXT_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-oauth-client-id
NUXT_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-oauth-client-secret
```

Make sure to create a D1 database use the SQL console of it to add your migrations from the `server/db/migrations` folder.

Link your D1 database with the `D1_DB` variable name to your CF Pages project (Settings -> Functions -> D1 database bindings). You may have to retry the latest deployment to make sure the binding is active.
